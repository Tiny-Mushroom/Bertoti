"We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned aboout scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth."

Developing a piece of software isn't just about the programming. Without the time and ability to discern between what you want and what you need for a project to wwork effectively and efficiently, one is simplpy typing words on a keyboard. Deciding what tools will better accomodate your requirements is an, if not the most, important step in not only the software environment, but for all sorts of engineering worldscapes.
